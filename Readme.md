## Usage

### Directly

Before anything, if you haven't installed Nix using the
[OpenLane 2 documentation](https://openlane2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/common/nix_installation/index.html),
make sure that:

1. You have Nix installed.
    * If not, see OpenLane 2's documentation on Nix-based installation linked
    above.
1. If you already have Nix installed, you have enabled the experimental Nix
   features `flakes` and `nix-command`.
    * If not, see this [this guide](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes#Other_Distros.2C_without_Home-Manager) for more info.
1. You have the OpenLane [Cachix](https://cachix.org) enabled.
    * If not, see the "If you already have Nix set up…" portion of the Openlane
    2 installation documentation linked above.

If you satisfy these conditions, you may use any of the tools by creating a Terminal shell with the tool as follows:

```sh
nix shell github:efabless/nix-eda#magic
```

then simply invoking `magic`. If you correctly set up the OpenLane cachix, you
won't have to build anything, but if you didn't, your computer will attempt to
build it.

You may also create a shell with multiple tools as follows:

```sh
nix shell github:efabless/nix-eda#{magic,xschem}
```

### As a dependency

To be documented, but you may refer to
[OpenLane 2](https://github.com/efabless/openlane2)
as an example of how to use this repository as a dependency. OpenLane 2 uses
this repository in addition to a number of other tools to provide a full
digital design environment.

Please note that the API for the functions provided in the Flake are not yet stable.
